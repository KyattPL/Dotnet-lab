        Say your prayers little one <br />
        Don't forget, my son <br/>
        To include everyone
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuck you in, warm within <br />
        Keep you free from sin <br />
        Till the sandman he comes
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleep with one eye open <br />
        Gripping your pillow tight
    </p>
    <p>
        Exit light <br />
        Enter night <br />
        Take my hand <br />
        Off to never never land
    </p>
    <p>
        Something's wrong, shut the light <br />
        Heavy thoughts tonight <br />
        And they aren't of snow white
    </p>
    <p>
        Dreams of war, dreams of liars <br />
        Dreams of dragon's fire <br />
        And of things that will bite
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleep with one eye open <br />
        Gripping your pillow tight
    </p>
    <p>
        Exit light <br />
        Enter night <br />
        Take my hand <br />
        Off to never never land
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I lay me down to sleep <br />
        (Now I lay me down to sleep) <br />
        Pray the Lord my soul to keep <br />
        (Pray the Lord my soul to keep) <br />
        If I die before I wake <br />
        (If I die before I wake) <br />
        Pray the Lord my soul to take <br />
        (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
    </p>
    <p>
        Hush little baby, don't say a word <br />
        And never mind that noise you heard <br />
        It's just the beast under your bed <br />
        In your closet, in your head
    </p>
    <p>
        Exit light <br />
        Enter night <br />
        Grain of sand
    </p>
    <p>
        Exit light <br />
        Enter night <br />
        Take my hand <br />
        We're off to never never land
    </p>
    <p>
        (BUM! Yeah, yeah)
    </p>
    <p>
        (Off to never never land <br />
        Take my hand <br />
        Off to never never land <br />
        Take my hand <br />
        Off to never never land <br />
        Off to never never land <br />
        Off to never never land <br />
        Off to never never land)
